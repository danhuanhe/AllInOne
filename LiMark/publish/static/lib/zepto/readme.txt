Note that some optional features of Zepto specifically target mobile browsers; as the original project goal was to specifically provide a leaner alternative to jQuery for the mobile web.

Zepto is a good choice for browser extensions (for Safari, Chrome and Firefox) and to develop HTML-based views within native app frameworks, such as PhoneGap.

In short, Zepto is expected to work in every modern browser and browser-like environment. Zepto doesn't support old Internet Explorer versions (<10).
